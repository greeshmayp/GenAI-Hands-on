        "Simple prompting is best for direct factual responses with low cost and latency. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) improves reasoning by breaking problems into steps and is useful for logical or mathematical tasks. Tree-of-Thought (ToT) explores multiple reasoning paths before selecting the best one, making it suitable for strategic decision-making but with higher computational cost. Graph-of-Thought (GoT) allows more complex reasoning structures and is powerful for creative and research-oriented tasks, though it requires the highest cost and latency. Therefore, it is recommended to start with CoT and only move to ToT or GoT when deeper reasoning is required.\n"
